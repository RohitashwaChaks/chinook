# Chinook
Based on Chinook database script available from the  [Chinook Database](http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/) site. 

> Chinook is a sample database available for SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, etc. It can be created by running a single SQL script. Chinook database is an alternative to the Northwind database, being ideal for demos and testing ORM tools targeting single and multiple database servers.

I have included scripts I use for creating various SQL items such as stored procedures and views. I blog about SQL and you can read about these examples from my blog [msiman.ga](http://msiman.ga).
